# Mergesort

- Pros
- Cons
  - Waste memory (space complexity: **O(n)**)

## Algorithm

1. Split collection into small sub-collection recursively until each sub-collection contains only one element.
2. Merge sub-collections back in order.

That's why merge sort is a great example for _divide and conquer_.
